  ## Election-Audit Summary
  The code created for this election analysis is a dynamic script that can be refactored to help enhance analysis of future elections. The script is efficient at analyzing all the data needed to provide insights, cross reference and present to constituents. Minimal modifications would need to be made to adapt it to any data set provided.
  
  additional updates could be made to analize additional data such as:
  - Demoghraphics (age, gender, race)
  - Political affiliation 
  - Georgrahpy by analyzing zip codes 
  - Percentage of registered voters that cast their votes
  
There is a lot we can learn about the our population's voting trends, and the script in this analysis can help ensure we extract all the information needed to gain as much knowledge as we can.
